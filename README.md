## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Mentor Query** → Entered via chat UI  
2. **NLU Engine** → Extracts intent, entities (e.g., student name, interest)  
3. **Data Retrieval** → Fetches student data from Airtable / Drive  
4. **RAG Engine** → Retrieves related content, grounds it in context  
5. **LLM Generation** → Produces personalized project ideas & summaries  
6. **Response Validation** → Confidence scoring + citation sourcing  
7. **Feedback Loop** → Mentor ratings used to refine the model

## 🧩 Key Design Decisions

| Area | Decision | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Chat Protocol** | WebSocket | Enables real-time two-way chat |
| **AI Model** | GPT + RAG | Combines creativity with factual grounding |
| **Data Storage** | PostgreSQL + Pinecone | Supports structured + semantic search |
| **Access Control** | JWT + Row-level filters | Ensures mentors see only assigned students |
| **Caching** | Redis + TTL | Reduces latency and API cost |
| **Scaling** | Kubernetes (HPA) | Handles concurrent mentors efficiently |

---

## 🧠 Generative AI & Quality Assurance

- 🧩 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Ensures factual accuracy by grounding LLM outputs in verified student data  
- 💬 **Contextual Chat Memory:** Maintains continuity across sessions  
- ✅ **Source Verification:** Every recommendation is attributed to data sources  
- ⚠️ **Confidence Scoring:** Low-confidence answers trigger clarifications  
- 🧹 **Content Filtering:** Removes bias and ensures age-appropriate recommendations
